# Plan: Windows-Only Documentation Alignment

## Phase 1: Documentation Inventory
- [x] Task: Audit active docs for Linux/macOS references and bash-oriented examples.

## Phase 2: Content Updates
- [x] Task: Update `README.md` quick start and pairing examples for Windows/PowerShell.
- [x] Task: Update `docs/configuration-guide.md` to Windows path and environment conventions.
- [x] Task: Convert runbook command blocks in release, rotation, and MVP checklist docs to PowerShell.
- [x] Task: Update PRD and roadmap docs (`PRD.md`, `plan-for-agents.md`, `TwinClaw-blueprint.md`) to Windows-oriented references.

## Phase 3: Verification
- [x] Task: Re-scan active docs to ensure Linux/macOS references are removed.
- [x] Task: Run full markdown linting/validation in a shell with `pwsh.exe` available.

## Progress Notes
- Operator-facing docs are now Windows-only.
- Archive content remains unchanged by design.
